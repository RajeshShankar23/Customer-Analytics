# Customer-Analytics
# Problem
The importance of understanding customers cannot be overstated in running a successful business, with KYC (Know Your Customer) being crucial for many companies. KYC facilitates tailoring offerings to customer needs, enhancing communication and delivery. Customer analytics, especially segmentation, is vital for effective marketing, encompassing various customer characteristics and behaviours. The STP (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning) framework is fundamental for exploring and understanding potential customers.
The dataset used here pertains to a B2C (Business to Consumer) model, offering ample data points for analysis. FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) companies, like supermarkets, provide abundant data, making them ideal for customer analytics courses. Segmentation involves dividing customers into groups with similar characteristics, aiding in predicting purchase behaviours and marketing responses. Marketers utilize demographic, geographic, and psychographic data for segmentation when consumer behavior data is limited or available. Targeting evaluates segment profitability, determining which segments to focus on and how to promote products. Positioning entails aligning product characteristics with customer needs, considering presentation and distribution channels. The Marketing Mix framework further guides positioning by addressing product presentation and distribution strategies.
The concept of the marketing mix is to develop the best product or service and offer it at the right price through the right channels. In this case study, we'll perform customer analytics that answers three fundamental questions about positioning and the marketing mix.

1.Will the customer buy a product from a particular product category when they enter the shop?

2.Which brand is the customer going to choose?

3.How many units is the customer going to purchase?
